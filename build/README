This is the README file for the Helma build files as part of the Helma Object Publisher. It is included in the current distribution (version 1.2pre as of 8 November 2001) downloadable at <http://helma.org/download>.

The build directory consists of the following files:

	ant.jar
	build.bat
	build.sh
	build.xml
	crimson.jar
	jaxp.jar
	README


PREREQUISITES
=============

To build Helma you need a software called Ant. Ant is a build system that was developed for the Jakarta Tomcat project. For more information about Ant, see <http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/>.

To run Ant, you also need JDK 1.3 or higher <http://java.sun.com/j2se/>.

For checking out the source files from Helma's CVS you also need a local installation of a CVS command-line client. More information about CVS at <http://www.cvshome.org/>.


STARTING BUILD PROCESSES
========================

A build process is started by invoking the shell script appropriate to your platform, ie. build.sh for *nix (Linux, NetBSD etc.) and build.bat for Windows systems.

The generic syntax is

	./build process

The parameter "process" specifies one of the following build processes.


BUILD PROCESSES
===============

checkout
	Fetches (or updates, resp.) the Helma source files from the CVS and copies them into the src/ directory (which will be created if necessary).

compile
	Compiles the source files contained in the src/ directory into the class/ directory (which will be created if necessary).

jar
	Stuffs the files in class/ together and saves them as .jar archive in the build directory. The file is named helma-yyyymmdd.jar.
	
javadoc
	Creates the Java API documentation for the Helma classes. The resulting files are saved into the docs/apidocs/ directory (which will be created if necessary).

package
	Executes all previous build processes (checkout, compile, jar, javadoc) and saves the created files in the directory helma-1.x/ (with 1.x being the version number). All directories will be created if necessary.

package-zip
	Same as "package". Additionally, the files in the output directory will be compressed as .zip file.

package-tgz
	Same as "package". Additionall, the file in the output directory will be compressed as .tar.gz file.

package-all
	Executes all previous build processes. The result is a complete and up-to-date (as in the CVS) installation of Helma, the API documentation, source and build files as well as compressed packages for *nix and Windows systems including all the files.
