    jaxp.jar
    README


PREREQUISITES
=============

The Helma build script is using a software called Ant. Ant is a build system that was developed for the Jakarta Tomcat project. For more information about Ant, see <http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/>.

To run Ant, you also need JDK 1.3 or higher <http://java.sun.com/j2se/>.

For checking out the source files from Helma's CVS you also need a local installation of a CVS command-line client. More information about CVS at <http://www.cvshome.org/>.


STARTING BUILD
==============

The build system is started by invoking the shell script appropriate to your platform, ie. build.sh for *nix (Linux, NetBSD etc.) and build.bat for Windows systems. You need to modify the script and set the JAVA_HOME to fit your system.

The generic syntax is

    ./build target

The parameter "target" specifies one of the build targets listed below.


BUILD A SNAPSHOT
================

To build a helma.jar with the most up-to-date version of helma yourself you need to run

    ./build checkout

and

    ./build snapshot
